# Pokedex App
A pokedex web app using AngularJS and [Pokeapi.co](http://pokeapi.co/).

This app was developed on the AngularJS Course that I gave. So I'm sharing the code for those who are interested in studying AngularJS.

## Pre requirements
- Node.js and NPM installed (I recommend to do something like [this](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/master/npm-global-without-sudo.md) to install global packages without sudo )

## How to run
- Install required npm packages, run this command on project folder :
```shell
npm install
```
- Start livereload server
```shell
npm start
```
